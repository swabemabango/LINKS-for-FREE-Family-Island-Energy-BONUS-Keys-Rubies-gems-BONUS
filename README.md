Energy acts as the primary limiting factor for actions within the game. Nearly every task, from chopping down trees and mining rocks to feeding animals and completing orders, consumes a certain amount of Energy. Once depleted, players must wait for it to regenerate slowly over time, use consumable items like food to replenish it, or spend Gems for an instant refill. This mechanic creates a natural rhythm to gameplay but can also lead to frustration during intensive events or story sequences. Gems, on the other hand, serve as the premium currency. They are used for a multitude of purposes, including purchasing rare items, speeding up production times, completing constructions instantly, and, most importantly, buying large quantities of Energy. While Gems can be purchased with real money, a core design philosophy of Family Island has been to provide numerous ways for dedicated free-to-play players to earn them steadily through gameplay.


Regarding Gems, the updates have been geared towards creating more meaningful and engaging avenues for acquisition beyond simple purchases. The event system has been the primary vehicle for this. Regular events, such as "Adventure Islands" and seasonal competitions, now offer substantial Gem rewards for reaching certain milestone points or completing specific tasks. This rewards active participation and strategic play rather than simply opening one's wallet. Additionally, the game has seen improvements in its achievement system and daily task lists, which now offer Gems for completing various in-game objectives, encouraging players to engage with all aspects of the game, from farming and crafting to exploration and collection.

The social features of Family Island have also received attention in relation to Energy and Gems. While the game is largely a solo experience, the ability to add friends and visit their islands has been made more rewarding. Visiting friends' islands can yield small Energy gifts, and certain events incorporate cooperative elements where helping friends contributes to mutual progress, indirectly conserving everyone's Energy and resources. Although not a direct source of Gems, this strengthened social aspect fosters a community that shares strategies for efficient Energy and Gem usage, enhancing the overall player experience.

Perhaps one of the most impactful recent improvements has been the refinement of the event balance and pricing structure. Earlier versions of the game were often criticized for events that were nearly impossible to complete without significant Gem expenditure. In response, Melsoft has shown a trend towards creating more accessible event storylines that can be completed with strategic Energy use and the free resources provided within the event itself, while still offering challenging bonus goals and premium reward tracks for players who choose to invest Gems. This creates a more satisfying experience for all player types, from casual free-to-play users to dedicated spenders.

Looking at the in-game economy, the developers have also made subtle but important adjustments to the value proposition of Gem purchases. While the core offers remain, there has been an increase in the frequency of limited-time "special offers" that bundle Energy, Gems, and unique items at a discounted rate. These offers often appear strategically, such as when a player's Energy is low or at the start of a major event, providing a more attractive option for players considering a purchase. For non-spending players, the game now offers occasional "gift" codes through its social media channels, which can provide a boost of free Energy and Gems, further bridging the gap.

The ongoing evolution of Family Island demonstrates a developer keenly aware of the importance of its core resources. The latest updates and improvements surrounding Energy and Gems have been thoughtfully designed to address long-standing player concerns about scarcity and accessibility. By enriching the ways players can earn both Energy and Gems through enhanced events, daily systems, strategic trading, and social features, Melsoft has struck a better balance between challenge and reward. This continuous refinement ensures that the game remains engaging and rewarding for its dedicated community, allowing players to focus on the joy of building, exploring, and uncovering the mysteries of the islands without feeling perpetually hindered by resource constraints. The management of Energy and Gems remains central to the experience, but the path to obtaining them is now more varied and player-friendly than ever before.


Family Island, a popular mobile farming and adventure game developed by Melsoft Games, has been evolving with several updates in 2025, bringing improvements to energy management, gameplay organization, and resource systems, as well as new features around gems, particularly rubies.

A key focus in recent updates has been on enhancing the energy system. Since many actions in Family Island consume energy, the developers have introduced free energy links that players can redeem daily to boost their energy reserves. These energy links are shared regularly on official social media channels and dedicated websites, allowing players to collect free energy multiple times a day without making in-app purchases. Daily updated links provide energy amounts ranging from 20 to 50 units, sometimes combined with other rewards. This system helps players sustain gameplay and progress without frustration due to energy shortages. Additionally, there are other ways to accumulate energy such as feeding the family, completing merchant and shaman orders, repairing buildings, and participating in events. Saving energy is also encouraged by spending it wisely on valuable tasks and utilizing in-game boosters that reduce energy costs.
